depths has a minimum at d = 4. This is likely because it is a good median point for where the model isn't too complex for data, but has enough layers to properly funnel the data. If there are less than 4 layers, more data is probably lost as the feature reduction takes too long. If there are more than 4 layers, 40 epochs is probably not enough to fully train all of the layers. At higher numbers of layers like d > 8, the error spikes upward.

There are a lot of dimensions in gene expression data, so reducing dimensions in an efficient way is extremely valuable as autoencoding perserves only the more meaningful data when it reduces dimensions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xSrr30kzudyK","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Writeup"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E6vPH5LmuzMl","colab_type":"text"},"source":["In part 1 of this homework, I learned a lot about machine learning classification with 2 classes. In part (a), I showed that sometimes more data is not better. Using some reason because you decide upon your final dataset can be useful. In this case, one may expect all of the genes to be a better dataset. However, if you think about, a dataset that only includes the protein encoding genes is more relevant. In part (b), I looked at different classical machine learning algorithms. I used LinearSVC, SVC, AdaBoost, KNeighbors, DecisionTree and RandomForest. I was not surprised to see LinearSVC perform the best, but it was interesting to see how quick RandomForest is while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. Also, it was noteworthy that KNeighbors had the least false positives. In part (c), I looked at the effect of feature reduction. It was interesting to see how many features could be removed and only have less than a 0.5% effect on accuracy while running in 1/8 the time. Finally in part (d), I looked at the effect of training with less samples. Similar to part (c), the testing error didn’t increase dramatically until we only used around 400 samples. Thus, this proves that removing samples also works as a technique to reduce runtime if there are a significant number of samples and the runtime is too long. \n","\n","In part 2 of the homework, I do the same thing, but with many classes. In (a), we get the same results as I did in part 1. This is not surprising, given the results in part 1a. In (b), I used AdaBoost, KNeighbors, DecisionTree and RandomForest. It was interesting to see how the results were similar except for AdaBoost, which performed worse. RandomForest performed the best, which wasn’t surprising as it did in part 1. Overall, it was cool to see the difference in the results between functions in part 1 and part 2. In (c), the testing error actually seemed to generally decrease as the number of features decreased. This is surprising as I expected the opposite as in part 1. One potential hypothesis I have for why this is the case is that a lot of features are only affiliated with having a tumor versus not having a tumor. Thus, they may provide misinformation in actually classifying the tumor. The decrease is very little, so the other option is just that the RandomTree model doesn’t use a lot of these features and thus the effect of removing features is minimal. In (d), the learning curve shows the effect of using less datasets. As in (d) of part 1, the testing error increases with less datasets. However, the training error increases at a faster pace than it does in part 1. This makes sense as there is more classifications and thus, it takes more data to train the model. The most significant difference to me between the many classifications than the 2 classifications is the runtime. All models took significantly longer in part 2. This shows the difficulty of using so many classifications. It appears that it is exponentially harder to train with more classifications.  \n","\n","In part 3, I looked at the effect of an autoencoder. In (b), I looked at the effect of changing the bottleneck size. The effect was as expected where the smaller the bottleneck, the greater the loss. However, I was surprised that the loss was still so low even when the bottleneck was so small. In part (c), I look at the effect of the depth of the bottleneck. It was interesting to see that the both a small depth and a high depth don’t perform well. The best was actually a median depth where it was still able to condense the data at a good rate, but wasn’t too large to train. Overall, it is clear that autoencoding is a great way to reduce the noise in data and even condense data if desired. \n","\n","Exploring the gene expression datasets was extremely insightful. It was cool to see how predictive the gene data could be and how easy it was to train a model that could determine whether the person has a tumor or not and what kind of tumor they have if they do. This is something that is broadly applicable. One thing that was so surprising was that there were so many ways to do this. A variety of different models were able to reasonably predict the tumor status, which truly shows the power of machine learning. If tumor status is something that is so easy to determine, the medical possibilities of more complex machine learning must be endless.\n"]}]}
